# Guitar Practice

I am the sole developer and designer of this application.

This iOS app takes the most common chord progressions ever used and randomly picks the chord voicings all over the guitar neck so not only is your practice guaranteed to sound musically coherent, you are also playing new combinations every time!

Guitar Practice has been featured on the website AppAdvice.com and a preview of Guitar Practice can be seen at this link: https://appadvice.com/app/guitar-practice/1513229012

Due to Apple Developer yearly subscription fees, this application is no longer published on the Apple App store.
